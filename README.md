# Static-Node.js-and-Express-Site
Unit 6 - Static Node.js and Express Site

This project utilizes Express to handle the web server part and PUG to handle the display of information.

The app display all the projects developed untill now by the developer in this course. As a pure javascript application
we are utilizing express in a way we can handle everything like a simple website with routes, data reading and templates.
As a template handler PUG make the built easier and simpler, following the documentation all the basics of this framework
have been utilized to make things clearer.

The approach utilized here its a little bit different, the routes have been added as a new Class to handle everything from router, and
in that way app.js looks clearer and more objective for the important stuff. 

All the project info is read from the data.json.
The projects images have been added to the static folder as the developer profile picture.
